"Hi,

Since I received my Allpowerfull M15x laptop, I always wanted to use the alienFX lights as an indicator of whether I am currently busy or available to talk to/etc... The solution provided by alienware would be to load up the alienFX software (takes a relative long time), load up a previously created profile, hit the apply button and exit the application. Suffice to say that this is really impractical to be of any use. The other major problem was that I use mainly Linux as my working environment and alienfx is not available for linux and the alienware software seems not to work on Windows over a virtual machine installed(tried both Vmware and VMBox).

Thus I decided to write my own alienFX program which would work under Windows and Linux. Here is the Result

I would be grateful for any comments and opinions on how to make the application better. Also, please let me know if you think the application is useless, so that I know if there is any point in further developing this application.

Description:
AlienFX Lite is a simple cross-platform program to create profiles and set the AlienFX lightning to the set colors. This application was done for the Allpowerfull M15x and only tested on this machine. It should also work on the M17x. The application will most likely accept the Area 51 m15x but it was untested. The current supported platforms are:
Linux (32 bit), Linux(64 bit), Mac OS X(UNTESTED), Windows 7(64 bit), Windows 7 (32 bit), Windows Vista (32bit), Windows Vista 64bit, Windows XP

Special Thanks:
Thanks go to Ingrater (http://3d.benjamin-thaut.de/) for providing me with the protocol for the alienFX device and some windows native code."
